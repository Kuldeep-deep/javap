        <h2>1. Java Basics</h2>
        <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language widely used for building web, desktop, and mobile applications. It is platform-independent, meaning Java applications can run on any operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Here are some key concepts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Syntax:</b> Java syntax is similar to C++ but is designed to be simpler and safer.</li>
            <li><b>Data Types:</b> Java supports various data types, including int, float, char, and boolean, along with objects and arrays.</li>
            <li><b>Control Statements:</b> Java includes if-else, switch, while, do-while, and for loops for controlling the flow of a program.</li>
            <li><b>JVM:</b> Java applications run on the Java Virtual Machine, which makes Java platform-independent.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles</h2>
        <p>Java is built around object-oriented programming principles, which helps developers create reusable and modular code. The four core principles of OOP are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Encapsulation:</b> The concept of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) within a class and restricting access to certain parts of the object to prevent data manipulation from outside.</li>
            <li><b>Inheritance:</b> A mechanism that allows one class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass).</li>
            <li><b>Polymorphism:</b> The ability for methods to take many forms, allowing one method to be used in multiple contexts, such as method overloading and overriding.</li>
            <li><b>Abstraction:</b> The process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential information to the user, making code easier to understand and use.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Exception Handling</h2>
        <p>In Java, exception handling is used to handle runtime errors and maintain the normal flow of the application. Java provides a robust set of tools for handling exceptions using try-catch blocks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>try-catch:</b> The try block contains code that might throw an exception, and the catch block handles the exception.</li>
            <li><b>finally:</b> The finally block executes code after try-catch, regardless of whether an exception was thrown. It's commonly used for resource cleanup.</li>
            <li><b>throw:</b> Used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or a block of code.</li>
            <li><b>throws:</b> Declares that a method can throw certain types of exceptions, warning the caller to handle these exceptions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Proper exception handling ensures that Java programs can recover from errors and continue running smoothly, improving their reliability and robustness.</p>
